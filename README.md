### useIntercom

the `useIntercom` does not accept anything and returns the following methods:

- `boot`

  The boot function can be used if at somepoint the shutdown function was called or `autoboot` is set to `false`.

- `reboot`

  Calls `shutdown` then `boot`

- `reboot.soft`

  Similar to `reboot` except this will use the previously captured options from `update/boot`

- `shutdown`

  If you have the Inbox product (combined with another product like Messages) you should call the Intercom shutdown method to clear your usersâ€™ conversations anytime they logout of your application. Otherwise, the cookie we use to track who was most recently logged in on a given device or computer will keep these conversations in the Messenger for one week. This method will effectively clear out any user data that you have been passing through the JS API.

- `shutdown.soft`

  Similar to shutdown except this will not clear previously captured options from `update/boot` so that it can be used on subsequent calls to `boot`

- `show`

  This will show the Messenger. If there are no new conversations, it will open to the Messenger Home. If there are, it will open with the message list.

- `hide`

  This will hide the main Messenger panel if it is open

- `showNews`

  If you would like to trigger a news item in the Messenger, you can use the `showNews` method. The news item will be shown within the Messenger, and clicking the Messenger back button will return to the previous context. If the Messenger is closed when the method is called, it will be opened first and then the news item will be shown.

- `showSpace`

  This will open the Messenger as if a new conversation was just created.

- `startTour`

  If you would like to trigger a tour based on an action a user or visitor takes in your site or application, you can use this API method. You need to call this method with the id of the tour you wish to show. The id of the tour can be found in the _Use tour everywhere_ section of the tour editor.

- `trackEvent`

  You can submit an event using the `trackEvent` method. This will associate the event with the currently logged in user and send it to Intercom

- `showTicket`

  If you would like to trigger a ticket in the Messenger, you can use the `showTicket` method. The ticket will be shown within the Messenger, and clicking the Messenger back button will return to the previous context. If the Messenger is closed when the method is called, it will be opened first and then the ticket will be shown.

- `startSurvey`
